## Hi there 👋

I'm Chawanzi, but you can call me Chaw. I'm a front-end developer who's all about creating awesome web and mobile applications. I live for turning ideas into user-friendly experiences with my magic coding skills.

When I'm not diving into code, you'll find me binge-watching, snacking on popcorn, or taking hikes to clear my mind. Oh, and did I mention I'm a die-hard fan of Bastille and Linkin Park? 🤘🏾🎼🎧

I'm up for collaborating on any JavaScript projects, and I'm totally open to new job opportunities, especially if they involve remote work. Let's connect and rock the coding world together!
